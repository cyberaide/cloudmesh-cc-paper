\section{Other Cloudmesh Features}

Cloudmesh comes with a sophisticated package management system, allowing to integrate packages on demand targeting varipus providers ond capabilities including a build in command shell and not just aonly a commanline tool.  Cloudmesh was first develped as a hybrid cloud API, commandline and command shell framework. It provided interfaces to AWS, Azure, Google, and OpenStack clouds for virtual machine\footnote{cloudmesh also provded support for clouds that are no longer supported such as Eucalyptsus and open cirrus. Academic clouds such as Chameloncloud were also supported.} and data file services. It is characterized be defining default templates for virtual machine management on these clouds. Hence it was possible to switch with only a view commands between clouds and stage virtual machines on them such as demonstarted in Figure~\ref{fig:cms}.
